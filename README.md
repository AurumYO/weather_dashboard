```

Run Celery Beat (for periodic tasks)

```bash
poetry run celery -A weather_dashboard beat --loglevel=info

```

## üîπ Running Tests

Run unit tests:

```bash
poetry run python manage.py test

```

## Populating CityWeather Data

To populate the City model with City data from the populate_cities.py, use the following command:

```bash
